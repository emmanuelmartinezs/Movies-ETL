# Movies-ETL
Wikipedia has a ton of information about movies, including budgets and box office returns, cast and crew, production and distribution, and so much more. Luckily, one of Britta's coworkers created a script to go through a list of movies on Wikipedia from 1990 to 2018 and extract the data from the sidebar into a JSON. Unfortunately, her coworker can't find the script anymore and just has the JSON file. We'll need to load in the JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame.
